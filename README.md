# Final project of Getting and Cleaning Data course
## The present project combines everything learned in each of the lessons and tutorials taught by the teachers.

It is also important to mention that this project involves everyday problems that we usually encounter in our work.

One of the biggest problems is that the categories are combined into variables, in addition to the little or no use of data type factor, because when used as text they are subject to unintentional errors when committing misspellings or abbreviate terms that did not make sense to do so.

The current project provides a solid basis for the problems described above and others that may arise during the data processing.
